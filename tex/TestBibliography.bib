It reflects recent calls for action on the part of the Council1 and the European Parliament,2 both of which have encouraged the Commission to revise the current approach to better reflect the increased challenges to critical entities, and to ensure closer alignment with the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive3. This proposal is consistent and establishes close synergies with the proposed Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union; (“NIS 2 Directive”) which will replace the NIS Directive in order to address the increased interconnectedness between the physical and digital world through a legislative framework with robust resilience measures, both for cyber and physical aspects as set out in the Security Union Strategy4.},

@book{Goodwin2013,
abstract = {Executive Summary Cybersecurity has become a priority for governments around the world. Major cyberattacks, data losses, and compromised networks fill the headlines, and governments, the private sector, and citizens all recognize the need for action to improve cybersecurity. Governments worldwide are struggling with questions around how to do this while balancing privacy, civil liberties, and cost. Over the past decade, national governments have been developing strategies to address emerging security issues associated with the rapidly expanding use of information and communications technology (ICT). These “cybersecurity” issues have developed into significant national-level problems that require government consideration, including the protection of assets, systems, and networks vital to the operation and stability of a nation and the livelihood of its people. Threats against these vital assets target corporations and citizens, and include cybercrime such as identity theft and fraud, politically motivated “hacktivism,”and sophisticated economic and military espionage. Unlike legal regimes covering privacy, which have evolved over time to include strong laws aimed at protecting consumer information and preventing online fraud, cybersecurity has not evolved a corresponding legal regime over the past decade. In the absence of regulation, ICT companies have developed standards and best practices to help establish strong security protections for products and services. As governments around the world begin to consider the appropriate legal framework for cybersecurity regulation, it is Microsoft's view that such a framework should be based upon a principled national strategy that sets a clear direction to establish and improve cybersecurity for government, academia, enterprises, consumers, and the ICT companies who serve those communities. Microsoft strongly supports governments taking steps to protect their most essential information and ICT systems—those needed to support national security, the economy, and public safety. A national cybersecurity strategy is critical for managing national-level cyber risks and developing appropriate legislation or regulation to support those efforts. As a global software company, Microsoft has observed dozens of national approaches aimed at addressing cyber risk, and has developed views about what makes for an effective national cybersecurity strategy. This document contains recommendations for policymakers for developing or improving a national security strategy. 3},

abstract = {This proposal is part of a package of measures to improve further the resilience and incident response capacities of public and private entities, competent authorities and the Union as a whole in the field of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection. It is in line with the Commission's priorities to make Europe fit for the digital age and to build a future-ready economy that works for the people. Cybersecurity is a priority in the Commission's response to the COVID-19 crisis. The package includes a new Strategy on Cybersecurity with the aim of strengthening the Union's strategic autonomy to improve its resilience and collective response and to build an open and global internet. Finally, the package contains a proposal for a directive on the resilience of critical operators of essential services, which aims to mitigate physical threats against such operators. This proposal builds on and repeals Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive), which is the first piece of EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity and provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the Union. The NIS Directive has (1) contributed to improving cybersecurity capabilities at national level by requiring Member States to adopt national cybersecurity strategies and to appoint cybersecurity authorities; (2) increased cooperation between Member States at Union level by setting up various fora facilitating the exchange of strategic and operational information; and (3) improved the cyber resilience of public and private entities in seven specific sectors (energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare, drinking water supply and distribution, and digital infrastructures) and across three digital services (online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services) by requiring Member States to ensure that operators of essential services and digital service providers put in place cybersecurity requirements and report incidents.},
